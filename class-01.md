# HTML
## Ch 1. Structure
- Web pages act like electronic versions of documents and newspapers

- Structure is important for helping readers understand messages you are trying to convey and navigate around document/content.

- Attributes tell us more about elemtents
  - Made up of *2( parts: attribute **NAME** and attribute **VALUE**
  
## Ch 8. Extra Markup
- ID: Used to edit a **UNIQUE** section of a webpage

- Class: Used to edit **multiple** sections of a webpage

- Meta: *'meta'* or *'meta data'* is stored in the 'head' section. 
  - meta data consists of 

## Ch 17. HTML5 Layout
- Use proper syntax when forming your layout for your web pages
  - Helps you and other programmers locate content in a more efficient manner

## Ch 18. Process & Design
- Building your wireframe is the most foundational part before actually building your website
  - Helps clear some ideas you have in your mind.
  - Spending some time with a wireframe overall makes the production of your website smoother
  
- Some questions you may ask yourself when building a website:
  - Why people visit your website
  - What visitors are trying to achieve when visiting your website
  - What information your visitors need
  - How often people will visit your site

# JS
## Ch 1. ABCs of Programming
- javascript can make a web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does

- Access Content:
    - can select an element and place 
    - can retrieve data from an element

- Modify Content:
    - replace text within the element
    - change the position or size of an image

- Program Rules:
    - Can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page
    - Gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and then display a large version of that image
    - A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayment

- Reaction to events:
    - You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
    - a button is pressed
    - when a link is clicked
    - information is added or not added in a form
    - an interval of time has passed

- a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
- scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step
- scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them
- a programmer must give the computer enough detail to perform the task as if every time were its first time
  
1. Define the goal
    - think of a puzzle or problem for the computer to solve
2. Design the script
    - split the goal into a series of tasks
    - like writing a recipe that it can follow
3. Code each step
    - each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands

- As tempting as it can be to start coding straight away, it pays to spend some time designing your script before you start typing it
    - Flowchart it (reference page 23)

- computers solve things programmatically

## Growth Mindset
- SEE and HEAR things 7 TIEMS

- Everything is hard at the beginning
  - Remember this as you go learn new topics and ideas.
- WRITE REFLECTIONS!!
